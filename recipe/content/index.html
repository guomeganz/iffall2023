                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Tomatoes and Eggs. A very simple but indisputably delicious dish which goes amazingly with rice. I personally think it is at its peak when sesame oil is added.</p>

                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>4 small to medium tomatoes</li>
                    <li>1 scallion</li>
                    <li>4 eggs</li>
                    <li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
                    <li>1/4 tsp white pepper</li>
                    <li>1/2 tsp sesame oil</li>
                    <li>1 tsp shaoxing wine</li>
                    <li>3 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
                    <li>2 tsp sugar</li>
                    <li>1/4-1/2 cup water</li>

                <h2>Notes</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>I've found this recipe works fine using a frying pan or shallow sauté pan instead of a wok.</li>
                    <li>The shaoxing rice wine can be substituted with dry sherry or mirin. In my experience, it also tastes fine with no alcohol added.</li>
                    <li>This dish tastes best when hot, so I'd advise serving it within ten minutes of leaving the stove.</li>
                    <li>Reheating this dish diminishes the quality somewhat, so best not to keep it more than one or two days in the fridge.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Start by cutting tomatoes into small wedges and finely chop the scallion.</li>
                    <li>Crack 4 eggs into a bowl and season with ¼ teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon white pepper, ½ teaspoon sesame oil, and 1 teaspoon Shaoxing wine. Beat eggs for a minute.</li>
                    <li>Preheat the wok over medium heat until it just starts to smoke. Then add 2 tablespoons of oil and immediately add the eggs. 
                    <li>Scramble the eggs and remove from the wok immediately. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>Add 1 more tablespoon oil to the wok, turn up the heat to high, and add the tomatoes and scallions. 
                    <li>Stir-fry for 1 minute, and then add 2 teaspoons sugar, ½ teaspoon salt, and ¼ cup water (if your stove gets very hot and liquid tends to cook off very quickly in your wok, add a little more water). 
                    <li>Add the cooked eggs.</li>
                    <li>Mix everything together, cover the wok, and cook for 1-2 minutes, until the tomatoes are completely softened.</li>
                    <li>Uncover, and continue to stir-fry over high heat until the sauce thickens to your liking. Serve!</li>

                        <p>Unlike a lot of websites, this one doesn't make me work very hard to find the ingredients. The instructions are dense, but ingredients are bolded for easier navigation. The instruction video on the side is also helpful.</p>

                        <p>This site stands out to me for its homepage. It separates dishes into different categories, and when you click on the categories, it takes you to a page separating them into even more categories. It's great for fast navigation and getting ideas when you don't really know what you want.</p>

                        <p>This site has a much more aggressive brand image, which is something I may want to consider for my own website. It has a lot of subsections in its recipes which may be of interest (ex: FAQs). They also have a button that will allow you to automatically add ingredients to your shopping list.</p>

                        <p>I like the presentation of the menu with a navigator for sections and large pictures for individual dishes. Being able to see what is being described is really helful, which is why I prefer it over other menu layouts. The design is light and elegant.</p>

                        <p>I really like the dark, elegant aesthetic of this site. There's also a clear, logical layout of information with strips running down the page. I like the alternation between image and text in some of the pages.</p>

                        <p>This site really highlights the grid pattern/clear organization I enjoyed about the other two sites. Information and visuals are laid out in neat squares and rectangles that are organized to fill the page. There's also great use of typography.</p>
