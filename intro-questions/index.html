        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</strong></li>
                <p>My name is Megan Guo. I'm a junior doing a BFA in Communication Design with a second major in CS.</p>
            <li><strong>Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</strong></li>
                <p>I primarily do illustration work, but I may also go into UI/UX in the future. I'm taking this class as a part of the BFA track.</p>
            <li><strong>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</strong></li>
                <p>I'm currently taking Web Dev, but I have no prior experience.</p>
            <li><strong>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</strong></li>
                <p>I want to be able to learn the similarities and differences between coding for web and coding for software.</p>
            <li><strong>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</strong></li>
                <p>Designing for screen is inherently a more interactive experience, since the screen size can change, the viewer can zoom and move around the screen, and there may be interactable links to take the viewer to other relevant places.</p>
            <li><strong>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</strong></li>
                <p><a href="https://www.zoo.org/">https://www.zoo.org/</a></p>
                <p>I guess I'm talking about design in a more visual sense, but I like the Woodland Park Zoo's website. The entire site incorporates a pleasant color palette and there's lots of pictures to keep it engaging. The first thing you seee is a slideshow of their animals, and the site is arranged so the most important things come earlier.</p>
            <li><strong>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</strong></li>
                <p><a href="https://www.pixar.com/">https://www.pixar.com/</a></p>
                <p>Pixar's website does a pretty good job at this. For me, simplicity makes a website clearer and more effective, and Pixar's website is actually very simple. It's basically one image with a navigation bar, and their feature films page consists of almost entirely icons. Clicking the icons leads you to more info. Easy to navigate, tells you what it needs to.</p>
            <li><strong>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</strong></li>
                <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/">https://www.youtube.com/</a></p>
                <p>Perhaps this is more practical than anything else, but I think the YouTube website is exactly what I want of it. It's easy to navigate, the videos are organized in an accessible manner, and the design is simple and highlights the thumbnails. It's not the most artisinal choice, but I like the practicality and ease of access.</p>
